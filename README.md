# FinancialAnalysisOfBanks
The purpose of this project is to utilize the power of Tableau to conduct a comprehensive 
financial analysis of the top 100 banks worldwide. By leveraging the data visualization capabilities 
of Tableau, this project aims to provide a visually engaging and intuitive platform for stakeholders 
to explore and understand the financial performance and trends exhibited by these banks.

The project report will serve as a valuable resource for investors, financial analysts, and decision-makers, 
offering deep insights into key financial indicators, risk profiles, and comparative analysis across the banking industry.

Ultimately, this project seeks to empower stakeholders with actionable information, facilitating informed 
decision-making and fostering a deeper understanding of the global banking sector.
